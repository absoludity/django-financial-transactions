Financial Transactions
======================

Financial Transactions is a Django app to import transactions from financial institutions, automatically assigning categories for individual transactions based on user-provided hints.


Quick Start
-----------

1. Add "financial_transactions" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'financial_transactions',
    )

2. Run `python manage.py syncdb` to create the Financial Transaction models.

3. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
  to create an account (you'll need the Admin app enabled), choosing a transaction format for the account (currently only CommerzBank csvs are supported, but I'll add forms as people need them.)

4. Import your transactions::

    ./manage.py import_transactions ~/mydata/2013-01-commerzbank.csv
